# XCode-Swift-Viper-Template

Easy to use Xcode VIPER files generation template. 
As Xcode file templates doesn't allow to create groups by the template, this solution uses normal folders. When the `Viper module Folders` is used, please remove blue folders and create respective group to compile. Tried to solve this, if anyone knows a way to do it, please submit a pull request :)
Comments are welcome.
